##Sensor Description

The MS5637 peripheral module provides the necessary hardware to interface the MS5637 digital barometric pressure and temperature sensor to any system that utilizes a Digilent Pmod™ compatible expansion ports configurable for I2C communication. The MS5637 sensor is a self-contained pressure and temperature sensor that is  fully calibrated during manufacture. The sensor can operate from 1.5V to 3.6V. The sensor module includes a high-linearity pressure sensor and an ultra-low power 24 bit ΔΣ ADC with internal factory-calibrated coefficients.
